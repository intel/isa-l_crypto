/**
 * @brief Run all crypto self tests
 *
 * When FIPS Mode is enabled, all isal_XXX API which performs any crypto processing
 * on a NIST-approved algorithm (such as isal_aes_cbc_enc_128) will require this function
 * to be run.
 *
 * This API can be run from the application or it will be run internally in the library,
 * after calling any of the isal_XXX API.
 *
 * Either way, once the self tests have passed, all API calls will be able to start
 * performing the crypto operation. If the self tests fail, no crypto processing will be done.
 *
 * This function is thread safe, so only one thread will run the tests and the rest of the threads
 * will wait until the tests are finished.
 *
 * @return  Self test result
 * @retval  0 on success, ISAL_CRYPTO_ERR_SELF_TEST on failure
