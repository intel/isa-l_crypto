/*
 * Function: sha512_sb_mgr_submit_sse4
 *
 * Description: Wrapper API for update routine of single buffer sha512,
 *              to comply with multi-buffer API.
 *
 *              This function will pick up message/digest and length
 *              information from  the argument "job", then call into
 *              sha512_sse4(). Argument "state" is passed in, but not
 *              really used here.
 *
 *              Note: message init and padding is done outside. This function
 *              expects a packed buffer.
 *
 * Argument: state - not really used.
 *           job - contained message, digest, message length information, etc.
 *
 * Return: SHA512_JOB pointer.
 *
